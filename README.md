# Indian Census Data Analysis (2011)

## Overview
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Indian Census data from 2011. The analysis was conducted using SQL for data querying and Tableau for data visualization. The dataset includes information on population, growth rates, sex ratio, literacy rates, and more, at both the district and state levels.

## Datasets
**Dataset Source**: https://censusindia.gov.in/census.website/data/data-visualizations

The analysis is based on three datasets:

1. **dataset1**: Contains the columns - District, State, Growth, Sex_Ratio, Literacy
2. **dataset2**: Contains the columns - District, State, Area_km2, Population
3. **dataset3**: Contains the columns - State, Literacy, Male_Literacy, Female_Literacy, Literacy_growth

## SQL Analysis

1. Total population in India in 2011.
2. Average growth in total population from the previous census.
3. Average growth in total population for each state from the previous census.
4. Average sex ratio for each state.
5. Average literacy rate for each state.
6. Average literacy rate greater than 90.
7. Top 3 states showing the highest growth rate.
8. Bottom 3 states showing the lowest sex ratio.
9. Top and bottom 3 states of literacy rate.
10. Male and female population for each district, ordered by state.
11. Male and female population for each state.
12. Literate and illiterate people per district.
13. Changes in literacy rate over the last decade for each district.
14. State with the highest number of districts with a female-majority population.
15. Difference in population growth between rural and urban districts.
16. Number of districts with a population density above the national average.
17. Number of districts with a population density below the national average.
18. Differences in sex ratio between states with high and low female literacy rates.

## Tableau Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard was created to visualize the analysis. Key features include:
- Filtering by state to view detailed information.
- Visualizations of total population, literacy rates, sex ratios, and population density.
- Comparison of district-level data within each state.

### Dashboard Visualizations
- **Population Density and Population by State**: Highlights the most populous states and districts.
- **Population of Each District**: Bar chart showing the population across districts within a selected state.
- **Literacy Rate of Each District**: Bar chart showing the literacy rates across districts within a selected state.
- **Population vs. Area**: Scatter plot showing the relationship between population and area for various districts.

## Conclusion
This project provides a detailed exploratory analysis of the 2011 Indian Census data, offering valuable insights into population distribution, growth rates, literacy levels, and sex ratios across different states and districts.
