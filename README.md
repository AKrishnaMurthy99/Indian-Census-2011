# Indian Census Data Analysis (2011)

## Overview
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Indian Census data from 2011. The analysis was conducted using SQL for data querying and Tableau for data visualization. The dataset includes information on population, growth rates, sex ratio, literacy rates, and more, at both the district and state levels.

## Datasets
**Dataset Source**: https://censusindia.gov.in/census.website/data/data-visualizations

The analysis is based on three datasets:

1. **dataset1**: Contains the columns - District, State, Growth, Sex_Ratio, Literacy
2. **dataset2**: Contains the columns - District, State, Area_km2, Population
3. **dataset3**: Contains the columns - State, Literacy, Male_Literacy, Female_Literacy, Literacy_growth

## Tableau Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard was created to visualize the analysis. Key features include:
- Filtering by state to view detailed information.
- Visualizations of total population, literacy rates, sex ratios, and population density.
- Comparison of district-level data within each state.

### Dashboard Visualizations
- **Population Density and Population by State**: Highlights the most populous states and districts.
- **Population of Each District**: Bar chart showing the population across districts within a selected state.
- **Literacy Rate of Each District**: Bar chart showing the literacy rates across districts within a selected state.
- **Population vs. Area**: Scatter plot showing the relationship between population and area for various districts.
